**Customer Behaviour & Business Insights**
Peak ordering happens on weekends (especially Fridays) and evenings — suggests targeting promotions around these times.
Large pizzas and classic flavors are preferred — suggests focusing product development and offers on these segments.
Some pizzas consistently underperform — potential candidates for removal or rework in menu/pricing.
Revenue & order spikes around mid‑year (July) — could reflect seasonality, holiday demand, or promotional effects.

**Recommendations Based on Analysis**
1. Introduce weekend and evening combo offers to capitalize on peak demand.
2. Focus marketing and product development on Classic & Chicken categories and Large-size pizzas — align with observed preferences.
3. Review or discontinue consistently low-performing pizzas (e.g., Brie Carre, Spinach) or rework their recipes/prices.
